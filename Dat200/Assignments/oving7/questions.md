1. Show the result when an initially empty AVL tree has keys 2, 1, 4, 5, 9, 3, 6, 7  inserted in order.
   Then the node in the last level will be:
   - [X] a) 6,7
   - [ ] b) 5,9
   - [ ] c) 7
   - [ ] d) 9

2.Suppose the numbers 7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2 are inserted in that order into an initially empty binary search tree. The binary search tree uses the usual ordering of natural numbers. Will the in-order traversal sequence of the resultant tree be the same for the numbers in the sequence 9,7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 2,6, 0, 4?
    - [x] a) Yes
    - [ ] b) No

3. The following numbers are inserted into two Trees.

   - an empty perfect binary tree and
   - a binary search tree
     in the given order: 20,10, 1, 3, 5, 15, 12, 16,34,87,35.
     The height of the binary tree and binary search tree, respectively, is.

   - [ ] a) 4,3
   - [X] b) 3,4
   - [ ] c) 3,3
   - [ ] d) 4,4

4.Construct a binary tree by using inorder and preorder sequences given below.

- Inorder:  D,B,H,E,I,A,F,C,G
- Preorder:  A,B,D,E,H,I,C,F,G
  Find the postorder traversal?

  - [X] a) D,H,I,E, B,F,G,C ,A
  - [ ] b) D,H,I,E,G,F,B,C,A
  - [ ] c) A,C,G,F,B,I,E,H,D
  - [ ] d) D,H,E,I,B,F,G,C,A

5.Consider the given AVL Tree.
        12
       /  
    8    18
     / \   /
    5   11 17
   /
  4

If node 2 is added to this, then the parent node of 5 in a balanced tree is:

    - [ ] a) 12
    - [ ] b) 11
    - [x] c) 4
    - [ ] d) 8
